The ideal user needs an app to create and navigate through books and authors. They can keep up with their book collection through CRUD. The user will also be able to see see details about the authors and further organize from there. If the user so chooses, they can also add a book to their cart and complete their purchase.

DESCRIPTION OF USER:
-The ideal user of this app is someone who needs organization for their own books or wish listed books.
-This app allows for a completely unique user experience for each user.
-The user has full customization of books and authors.

LESSONS LEARNED:
-Learned how to use Firebase's REST API instead of the SDK, which makes standard fetch requests, which in turn, are safe for both client and server environments.
-Navigation with React (pages are case sensitive)
-Hooks (gained more knowledge)
-Learning more about ASKING FOR HELP (Still a work in progress)
